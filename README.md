# Chat-Rooms
This project is a testament to my self-guided learning journey in Swift and SwiftUI. It showcases the basic functionalities of a chat room app, including user login/registration, chat room viewing, message sending, and username updating. 

### Features

- Built with the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern to separate UI, data, and logic, making the code more maintainable and readable.
- Firebase, a third-party service is used for data storage. 
- Using asynchronous network calls (async await) to fetch and update data concurrently while ensuring readability.
- Dark-mode compatible



### What I learned

- Enhanced my understanding of SwiftUI
- Practiced working with backends
- Enhanced my understanding of async/await in Swift

### TODO

Notice that this project is far from perfect, as it has just achieved the basic functionalities of a real-world chat room app. Some features to be implemented are listed as follows:

- Update users with avatars and bio
-
